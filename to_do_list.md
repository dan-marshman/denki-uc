## Constraints
* Think there is an error in the minimum up/down times.
* Make constraints work for using the minimum up down times based on behaviour in the previous day.

## Sanity checks
* Check the minimum up/down equations

## Denki series
* Make link for initial state based on previous day, and minimum upd/down time from previous day.
* Check that correct traces are being chosen. Try look_ahead_intervals longer than a day. 
* Add functionality to resolve failed days
